Mediadef is a simple syntax for describing 
a set of outlets, feeds and their properties. 
Outlet is a set of feeds, ie a news website and 
feed is a source producing URLs of news articles. 
Folder config/mediadef contains some example mediadef files. 

Application is configured with a single mediadef file, 
(via config/feedsucker.properties file), this file is 
read and parsed on app start and the feeds and outlets
are stored in the database.
New feeds and outlets will be added in each new app run, 
existing ones will be updated with new values, but the removed ones 
will not be automatically removed from the database.

*** SYNTAX

Each line is either a comment (starting with //), a blank line, 
or a line describing an entity (feed or outlet) via set of properties. 
The syntax of an entity line is: @entity [property=value;]* 
For example: 
@outlet name = h-alter ; url = http://www.h-alter.org/ ; language = hr
@feed url = http://www.h-alter.org/rss ; outlet = h-alter
After an @entity header follows a list of properties property = "value".
apostrophes are optional but required if a property 
contains special characters or whitespace.
Prop/value pairs must be separated by a ";". 
Properties:
-- outlet - must have a "name" property. 
-- feed
feed must have "url" and "outlet" properties, 
value of outlet prop must be a name of one of the outlets from the file. 
"language" property, if undefined, is set to "en", otherwise it 
. must be a valid ISO 639-1 language code
"type" property, if undefined is set to "synd" (syndication feed), 
. other supported option, for now, is "html"
