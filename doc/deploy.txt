These are instructions how to deploy a working instance of feedsucker. 
First check prerequisites.txt to see if all the neccessary resources are present.

1. Create deploy folder with feedsucker code and resources
you can use the bash script to do this automatically: 
scripts/deploy_from_git_repo.sh (also created the database, 
see the code for documentation)
Otherwise:
1.0 Take the code and resources from the git repository
1.1 Create config files
Create persistence.xml from persistence.template.xml 
Create feedsucker.properties from feedsucker.properties.template 
These files are not git-tracked since they are deploy-specific

2. Create the database
Create a user/login role and a database (with UTF-8 encoding).
Default configuration options assume a 'feedsucker' login role and 'feedsucker' password
Script deploy_from_git_repo.sh does this for you if you use postgres, 
the script assumes that a 'feedsucker' login role is created
 
3. Create mediadef file
mediadef file contains description of feeds and outlets you want to monitor
doc/structure/mediadef.txt contains more information

4. Configure the application
main config files are config/feedsucker.properties (app config)
and src/META-INF/persistence.xml
For more info, see the comments in files. 
Make sure to specify the name of the database you will be using.
Default app config options should work well. 

5. Compile the code
On linux, run build.sh from feedsucker deploy folder, 
optionally specifying java location. 
Quick way to compile on any platform is to create NetBeans
project and compile (add feedsucker source files and 
jars in lib folder to the project).

6. Run
App has to be started from feedsucker root folder.
Check run.sh and feedsucker.sh for more details. 
Best way to run is to run the app in LOOP mode:
./feedsucker.sh LOOP START
stopping is done by: 
./feedsucker.sh LOOP STOP
There is more about LOOP and standalone mode in the documentation.
Ways to run the standalone app:
- directly: java -jar Feedsucker.jar 
- by executing: run.sh script
- via feedsucker.sh control script
feedsucker.sh START [java_location]

7. Newspaper stopwords
Newspaper text scraping algorithm needs a language-specific stopword list.
These lists are located in resources/text subfolder of newspaper, 
on linux they could be in:
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/newspaper/resources/text
Lists for some langugages are already there, and
resources subfolder of newspaper contains some word lists.
