Tools encompass supporting functionality and utilities. 
They are run by invoking Feedsucker (java -jar Feedsucker.jar) 
with following arguments: JAVA_RUNTIME_PATH TOOL_NAME [TOOL_PARAMS]

- loop
Loop tool is used to control the Feedsucker app. 
The app can freeze or crash within weeks of running, 
and until this is solved the app is periodically restarted
(and maybe even after the fix it might be 
wise to do so, to preempt unknown bugs).
Loop tool is a stan alone process that controls the 
main app via file-based messaging and a bash script (for now):
restarts it, or starts it if it crashed. 
It is configured via main configuration file. 
-- starting app in loop mode
./feedsucker.sh LOOP START path_to_java
path_to_java can be "default_java" to use default java command, 
or full path to the folder containing java
-- stopping app started in loop mode
./feedsucker.sh LOOP STOP
Starting and stopping must be performed from feedsucker root folder.

- fill
java -jar Feedsucker.jar java fill FILE_OR_FOLDER
Used for populating the database with articles collected
from other sources, via a set of files mimicking 
a feed and containing article URLs. 
For example, can be used for filling holes in the database
due to server crash, URLs of articles for the missing dates can 
be retrieved from news site archives, stored to a file and 
processed via fill tool which will store them to database.
Command invokes FeedFiller class, that reads files in a folder or single file, 
each file starting with feed url, each line containing
an article URL optionally preceeded with a line containing a date. 
Than it scrapes and stores the articles using feedsacker app. 

- hosts
java -jar Feedsucker.jar java hosts > hosts.txt
Print host names of all article URLs in the database. 

- table 
java -jar Feedsucker.jar java table
Writes out articles in the database in txt table 
suitable for reading as R table or pandas dframe.
