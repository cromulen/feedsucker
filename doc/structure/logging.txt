Actions of the apps as well as errors are logged in XML format. 
All the logs are written in a log/ folder, and one timestamped
log subfolder is created per run, notice that the Loop tool
also creates one such log folder and that each time the 
app is restarted during Loop run, another log folder will be created. 

For each run, several log files are created, one for each category of events, 
as well as errorUrl.log with url of the articles that were not
persisted due to an error at some processing step.

URL that caused an error can later be processed successfully, to 
determine amount of "error urls" in the database, run 
extractErrorUrls.sh and checkErrorUrls.sh DB_NAME from the log/ folder. 
For checkErrorUrls script, change of db connection params might be necessary. 

Logs can be searched/filtered with xpath queries 
using BaseX (packaged with the app).
Examples of xpath queries are in log/xpath_queries.txt . 
To browse the logs, firs merge all log files from all per-run folders, 
for example: ./merge_logs.sh error errorLogs.xml
and then start BaseX: ./run_basex.sh errorLogs.xml basex.out
Answer yes to the question weather to create database and
then just enter xpath queries in the "Find" field on top.
