1. DBMS
You have to install a JPA-compatible DBMS.
Feedsucker has been developed and tested with PostgreSQL
and all the settings and helper scripts (for now) assume working with pgsql.
To install it on linux, try: apt-get install postgresql pgadmin3
If some other DMBS is used, you will have to create the database manually, 
and change src/META-INF/persistence.xml (JPA configuration) 

2. newspaper/python
Text scraping tool used for now is newspaper: 
http://newspaper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
You need python and newspaper installed
-- this could work on linux:
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev // needed for lxml
sudo pip install newspaper
-- test the newspaper app
To check if all the python dependencies are installed 
and work well run console_interface.py from newspaper folder
on the first line enter language code, for example 'en'
than enter one URL per line, for each URL newspaper should
scrape the web page and print the data. enter EXIT to exit.
